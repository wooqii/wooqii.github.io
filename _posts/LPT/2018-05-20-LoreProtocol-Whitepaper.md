## Introduction
Lore is a knowledge community based on a protocol that maximizes the participation of network. It is designed to inspire the participants’ passion for knowledge by integrating conventional knowledge community with incentive mechanism design that is found in cryptocurrency. Members of Lore network enhances their capability to contribute to the entire network with self-derived insights in the process of knowledge sharing based on quality communication.

Lore consists of network, protocol, session, and token. Network is a group of Lore participants who contribute to the mutual development of knowledge through communication. Protocol is a set of rules and incentive design derived from the consensus of network. Session is a study group that may operate on its own protocol and maintain close coordination with the network as a whole. Token is a tool that is utilized to incentivize the session or activity of network and is issued in accordance with the protocol.

Currently, Lore is operating one session which is a bookclub. The bookclub discusses on ‘The Age of Cryptocurrency’.  The session covers historical, ideological and technical foundation of Bitcoin and the early community and major events revolving the ecosystem. Meanwhile, the participants recollect their thoughts on cryptocurrency as they compare it with its origin. The bookclub sets the limit for the number of participants in each session in order to ensure the conversation time for each participant. This limitation works as a scarcity which provides value to the utility of token. Also the session incentivizes active participation and proof of work including products that are derived from the session. (For more details, refer to the protocol documentation)

In the future, Lore intend to establish an interoperable protocol based on the consensus of the entire network and reach scalable solution by facilitating various session. Furthermore, it intends to incentivize the session leaders and quality product from sessions to encourage more development. Eventually, Lore hope that the growth of knowledge network can contribute to the ecosystem of cryptocurrency and the society in general.
